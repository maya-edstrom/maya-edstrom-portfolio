<center><p style="width: 850px;"> I am currently a graduate student studying cartography and GIS through UW-Madison. I previously recieved my undergraduate degree from
Scripps College in Claremont, CA in Environmental Analysis. My favorite part about GIS and mapmaking is the intersection of art and science/logic. I also have been working
as a GIS Specialist at an environmental engineering company for just under a year now. </p></center>

<center><p style="width: 850px;"> When not studying or doing homework, I love spending time in nature, especially in the woods or by a lake.
I enjoy sewing, reading, writing snail mail to friends, and spending time with mt two cats, Scout and Miko. I love all things creative; above is a 35mm film photo I took and developed of my dad on the Superior Hiking Trail.
